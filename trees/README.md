# Under Star âœ¨

I was listening to *Under Star* by Shocking Lemon and decided to make a landscape using stars and L-systems to generate trees.

## How to run the code 

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
```console
git clone https://github.com/UnMoutonPerdu/generative-art/
```

2. Go to the `trees` folder.

3. Open the `.html` file from the project in your favorite browser.
