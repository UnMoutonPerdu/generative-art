# Generative Art

This repository is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of **generative art** — art created through algorithms and code. Here, you'll find a collection of scripts, projects, and experiments that use programming to generate unique, dynamic, and often unpredictable artworks.

## Features 

- All code is written in JavaScript using the `p5.js` library.
- No additional tools required — just a browser to view and interact with the art.

## How to run the code 

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
```console
git clone https://github.com/UnMoutonPerdu/generative-art
```

2. Open any `.html` file from any project in your favorite browser.
